# Student Robotics Style Guide

The Student Robotics public style guide.

## Getting Started

1. [Install Ruby 3][install-ruby]

   See `.ruby_version` for the precise version, though 3.3 or above will
   probably be fine.

2. Install Bundler (2.3 or above) and Rake.

   Depending on how you have installed Ruby these may already be installed.

    ``` console
    $ gem install bundler rake
    ```

3. Start the app in development mode

    ```shell
    $ rake dev
    ```

## Making changes

When you've made a change, either push it to a forked repository, or to a
feature branch, and [raise a pull request][raise-a-pr].
