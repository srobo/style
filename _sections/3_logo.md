The font used in the logo is [Quicksand][quicksand].

### Using the logo

Guidelines regarding use of the logo are as follows:

#### In Context

* The logo must not be used to impersonate Student Robotics. Student Robotics
  is a registered charity (1163168) in England and Wales.

* The logo shouldn't imply any sort of relationship with, or endorsement of,
  anything or anyone unless you've received written confirmation from
  Student Robotics. To get in touch regarding this, please email
  [pr@studentrobotics.org](mailto:pr@studentrobotics.org).

* There should be sufficient spacing around the logo so as to make it not look
  cramped. We recommend spacing of approximately 5% of the size of the logo.

* The logo should be placed on a background which complements the colours. Do
  not, for example, place the blue logo on a similarly coloured blue background.

#### Design

* Do not tamper with the colours of the logo.

* Do not change the aspect ratio of the logo. Feel free to resize the logo, but
  do not stretch or squash it out of proportion.

* Do not change the spacing, alignment or relative position of any of the
  elements (e.g. symbol, text).

* Try to stick to using the SVGs above. If you need to convert the logo into a
  different format, do not significantly degrade the quality of the image.
